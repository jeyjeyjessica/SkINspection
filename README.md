# SkInspection
Skin cancer is considered as one of the most dangerous types of cancers.  

Recognizing the type of skin cancer automatically from the images can assist in quick diagnosis and enhanced accuracy, saving valuable time.  

The objective of this project is to deploy a **deep learning** based model to an android application, to detect 7 types of different skin cancers.  

The android app is developed using **Java** in Android Studio.  

The user interface of the application consists of login and registration screens. The data entered during registration is stored in the **SQLite** database.
